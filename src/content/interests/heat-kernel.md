Heat kernel is by far one of the most awe-inspiring topics in mathematics. It is in my humble opinion an omnipresent topic in mathematics and beyond. Moreover, The spectral theory associated to Laplacian delivers so much useful information that people has been using various tools to study its behaviour. This includes, but not limited to: number theory, representation theory, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, etc. I plan to blog my minor knowing about it in near future.
