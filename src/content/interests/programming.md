I have only picked up programming half an year ago. Nonetheless, I find the coding community has been insofar the most willing-to-share group of people and I have learnt a lot from people such as [Harrison Kinsley](https://pythonprogramming.net/) and [Brad Traversy](http://traversymedia.com/). In near future I will keep a list of useful websites from where I gathered coding tips.
