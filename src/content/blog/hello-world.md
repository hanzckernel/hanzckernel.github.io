Welcome to the freshly rebuilt version of my personal website! After years of hosting a bare-bones Jekyll page, I finally decided it was time for a complete overhaul.

## Why the Rebuild?

The old site served its purpose — a simple landing page linking to my academic work and a few projects. But as my interests expanded into web development and deep learning, I wanted a platform that could **grow** with me.

### The Stack

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build/) as the framework for a few key reasons:

- **Zero JS by default** — pages ship as static HTML unless I explicitly opt into interactivity.
- **Content Collections** — type-safe Markdown that makes managing blog posts and project entries a breeze.
- **Islands Architecture** — I can sprinkle React components exactly where I need them (like the interactive Arcade cards) without bloating the rest of the pages.

Paired with **Tailwind CSS** for styling and **Framer Motion** for subtle animations, the result is a site that feels modern and snappy while scoring 95+ on Lighthouse.

## What's Here

- **The Arcade** — interactive demos of my web projects, embedded right into the page.
- **The Gallery** — my academic papers and lecture notes, presented in a visual masonry layout.
- **This Blog** — where I'll write about mathematics, programming, and the intersection of the two.

Stay tuned for more posts. The next one dives into the intuition behind heat kernels — one of my favourite topics in geometric analysis.
