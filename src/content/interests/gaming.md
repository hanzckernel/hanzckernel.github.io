I am mildly addicted to all sorts of games, from sandbox games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/de-de/) to indie games like [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/). My recent favorite is [Autochess](https://www.zizouqi.com/en.html). [CD Project Red](https://en.cdprojektred.com/), [Rockstar](https://www.rockstargames.com/) and [Blizzard North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_North) are amongst my faviourite gaming companies.

I am a lousy RTG, MOBA (~3000MMR) and Go (~20Kyu) player. I was a Bloodelf Priest of healing spec for two years.
