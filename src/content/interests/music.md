I was FORCED to play seven years of piano. Now I am an dilettante of classical music and its theory. I do particularly enjoy early Russian school composer such as [Sergei Rachmaninoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff), [Peter Tchaikovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Rachmaninoff) as well as [The Mighty Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_(composers)). [Vladimir Horowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Horowitz) is my role model and my favourite pianist. Other pianists in my Hall of Fame include [Arthur Rubinstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rubinstein) and [Art Tatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Tatum). As for conductors, I frequented the recordings of [Yevgeny Mravinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Mravinsky) and [Wilhelm Furtwängler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Furtwängler).

[Here](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/wagner/ringmotives/alphindex.html) you can find the semi-complete list of all motives in [Der Ring des Nibelungen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen) which I found very useful in understanding motives. (NOT MATH MOTIVES!)
